		<!-- <p>I've always been drawn to well designed things. I grew up skateboarding and listening to metal in Rockland County, NY. As a teenager, I loved the skateboarding culture and the artwork that accomapnied it. I remember obsessively staring at the detail of the graphics on the bottom of the skate boards in skateboard catalogs and the photos, use of type and whitespace in skateboard magazines. My friends and I used to take pictures and video of eachother skateboarding and doing stupid things, editing those photos and videos to share with a larger group of friends.</p>

		<p>Back in the dial up days kids used to use aol instant messanger to communicate. Turns out you could build these little programs or scripts to run inside the chat window. I had a friend who used to craft these little gems and unleash them on unsuspecting enemies. Because the script would essentially overload your bandwith, you're connection drop and you would be punted from the chat service, but not until you experienced a mini masterpiece. Imagine rainbows and middle fingers and pot leaves - all crafted with code. I found this whole experience mezmerizing! In between skate sessions, I started to watch over his shoulder as he would tinker - asking questions to learn more about the code he was writing, eventually crafting a punter of my very own.</p>

		<p>The web was just starting and as websites started to look more appealing, I started peering under the hood to understand how it was done.</p>

		<p>Loving technical challenges and systems thinking, I went to school for Networking and Telecommunications technology, but soon realized that I missed having art be more a part of my day t day. I switched schools, trasnferring to SUNY New Paltz to persue a BFA in Graphic Design. Even though the web was moving quickly, the majority of my studies were focused on print and foundational design principals.</p>

		<p>After school, I moved out west to be with my girlfriend, now wife, while she persued her degree. I started off working at a Sir Speedy printing press and then at a mom and pop design agency as the only designer in the office, reporting to a remote Creative Director. I did that for a few years while working part time with a high end wedding photographer and then we decided to move back east.</p>

		<p>2008/09 the market took a dive and no one was hiring. So, I started working for myself and used whatever connections I had to find jobs. I made a personal site for a friends coworker who was an opera singer. I picked up overflow work from the agency I previoulsy worked at, making playbills for AZ Opera and flash banners for Hoover Dirt Devil. I made logos for the company my aunt works for and logos for photographers I networked with. I got tired of filling out paperwork and chasing clients when all I wanted to do was get better at being a designer / developer, so I started looking for a full time job.</p>

		<p>Priceline stood out for me because of the brand recognition and because it didnt mean commuting to NYC. It was 5 years ago that I started there. It's changed dramatically over those 5 years. The technology, management style, office culture, processes, etc. All are different. Priceline seems to find an interesting balance, fluctuating between feeling like a stable corporate, top-down initiative and a lean, bottom-up, collaborative endevor. We are small relative to our competitors, so we can move more easily. The challenge is staying on par or ahead of the curve. It's a great learning experience figuring out how to navigate the variety of technical, design and management efforts we are tasked with, but I enjoy it.</p> -->
