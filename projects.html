		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>To intro ourseves to the group, please write 5 short phrases about yourself. These can be things you like, a mention of where you grew up, something you do or don't believe, a phobia, something no one else knows about you, etc. Be creative!</p>
		<p>We are going to use these phrases to begin to explore HTML, and to build our first webpages together!</p>
		<p>You can see 5 phrases I wrote about myself <a href="http://brianmccormack.github.io/uconn-design1/about-v1.html">here</a>. This page was written in <abbr>HTML</abbr>. HTML is used to identify and display content, not to style it, thats why it looks so boring. <a href="http://brianmccormack.github.io/uconn-design1/about-v2.html">Here</a> is what this page can look like with just a little bit of <abbr>CSS</abbr> applied.</p>
		<p>Your final About Me page will have a photo, 5 short phrases about you, a link and should be styled with <abbr>CSS</abbr>.</p>
		<p class="projects__last-p"><em>To complete the project, post a link to your About Me page to <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/c0kim9ht9mq9q1uoddr94g5qhjg">our Google Community Event for "About Me."</a></em></p>

		<h2>Resume</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Find <strong>at least 3</strong> resumes that are well designed. Print them out to bring into class. This will be a good place to start taking about core design principals such as Contrast, Repitition, Alignment and Proximity.
			</li>
			<li>
				After discussing some best practices when <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/the-art-of-the-design-critique" target="_blank">giving</a> or <a href="http://viget.com/inspire/critiquing-design-with-designers" target="_blank">recieving</a> feedback, we will critique our classmates' resumes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Based on feedback, we will iterate on our designs, creating 3 more resumes where we futher expiriment with the principals of design discussed in class.
			</li>
			<li>
				Students will present their updated resume designs, discussing their thought process and how they applied the core design principals we've discussed for each iteration. They will solicit feedback from the class to understand what is working and where there are areas for improvement.
			</li>
			<li>
				We will run through a <a href="http://brianmccormack.github.io/aboutbrian/resume.html" target="_blank">live coding demonstration</a> to surface any hurdles you might face when developing your own resume.
			</li>
			<li>
				After settling on a single resume design, students will be responsible for building their own resumes with <abbr>HTML</abbr> &amp; <abbr>CSS</abbr>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Students should post a link to their resume in <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/copk6ccl0mka96kpgcbfauou6b8" target="_blank">this Google Event</a>.
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		

		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<em>Class critique and live demos will occur throughout this project.</em>
		<ol>
			<li>Find and share portfolios that are well designed and have content written/organized in compelling ways.</li>
			<li>Discussion of site goals and the inportance of defining goals early on in any project.</li>
			<li>Group brainstorm session for content creation, followed by content grouping exercise.</li>
			<li>Document all text for your portfolio, including social profile urls, project details, headlines, tag lines, etc. We will share this content with the group.</li>
			<li>Define your content hierarchy.</li>
			<li>Compile design elements you would like to incorporate into your portfolio in a single Pinterest board. This will act as your moodboard for the portfolio project.</li>
			<li>Create a sitemap for the portfolio to articulate the overall site structure and how you will navigate from page to page.</li>
			<li>With these design elements and content hierarchy in place, begin to sketch mobile, tablet and desktop size layouts for your portfolio site keeping in mind that these are not 3 separate experiences.</li>
			<li>Evolve sketches into wireframes giving more definition to the layout, content and visual hierarchy.</li>
			<li>Experiment with ways to apply the tone that you established in your moodboard to the portfolio.</li>
			<li>Consider places to layer in simple animations to breathe a bit more life to the portfolio experience.</li>
			<li>Develop portfolio starting with mobile screen sizes adding in breakpoints to account for where the content needs to shift.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Husky App Challenge</h2>
		<p>In the spirit of a Design Studio, we will concept, pitch, sketch, refine an idea for an <abbr>UCONN</abbr> realated app. By the end of the class you will create a clickable prototype with your team and then pitch the idea/prototype to the class.</p>
		<h3>Guidelines</h3>
		<strong>The app can be for:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Anything related to <abbr>UCONN</abbr></li>
			<li>A single or multiple tasks</li>
		</ul>
		<p><a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AAzVmgb_UUFHY44dOwjcVx5mTzJZp_wNHKU"target="_blank">Here are some ideas</a> to get you moving if you feel stuck.</p>
		<strong>Bonus Points:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><em>How can it make money?</em><br>If in-app purchases are available, what are they and how to they enhance the experience</li>
			<li><em>Plan for repeat engagement</em><br>Consider how you might use push notifications or email marketing to keep customers coming back</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Process</strong>		
		<ol>
			<li>Diverge &mdash; Brainstorm ideas / app research &amp; inspiration <em>- 15 minute (individual exercise)</em></li>
			<li>Converge &mdash; Choose your best ideas (2 max) and write a quick pitch that you will give to your team to explain what the app is &amp; does.<em>- 10 minutes (individual exercise)</em></li>
			<li>Pitch idea(s) to team members <em>- 20 minutes</em></li>
			<li>Team vote / refine idea <em>- 10 minutes</em></li>
			<li>Diverge &mdash; Sketch the app screens <em>- 10 minute (individual exercise)</em></li>
			<li>Converge &mdash; Present sketches to team for alignment <em>- 15 minutes</em></li>
			<li>Refine sketches / wireframes &amp; write a paragraph description for the app store describing what your product is / does</li>
			<li>Use the app <a href="https://popapp.in/" target="_blank">Prototyping on Paper</a> to stitch together the interaction through the app.</li>
			<li>Post the url to your clickable prototype to <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cga3v080ckpktgj8fsk62cm79r8" target="_blank">this google event</a>, including your paragraph description and the names of each of your team members.</li>
			<li>Present your app to the class, gathering feedback on what could be clearer, how the app could be more useful, how to keep customers coming back, etc.</li>
