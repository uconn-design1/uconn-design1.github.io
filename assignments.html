		<h2>About You</h2>
		<p>To intro ourseves to the group, please write 5 short phrases about you. These can be things you like, a mention of where you grew up, something you believe, a phobia, etc. Be creative!</p>
		<p>We are going to use these phrases to begin to explore HTML, and to build our first webpages together!</p>
		<p>You can see 5 phrases I write about myself <a href="assignment-about/brian-v1.html">here</a>. This page was written in <abbr>HTML</abbr>. HTML is used to identify and display content, not to style it, thats why it looks kinda boring.</p>
		<p>Please download an HTML template for this project <a download href="assignment-about/template.html">here</a> and add your own content.</p>
